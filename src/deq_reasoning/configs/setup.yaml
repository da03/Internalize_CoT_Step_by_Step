# Outputs of an experiment are stored in a directory created by Hydra of the form
# outputs/${outputs_subdir}/${hydra.job.name}/${job_subdir}/${now:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S-%f}
# This has been designed to allow flexibility and can be configured in the sections below.

# Outputs are saved in outputs/${outputs_subdir}/...
# so you can store them in different physical locations if you want
# by symlink-ing outputs_subdir to a different location.
# outputs_subdir can also be useful to separate "dev" and "run" outputs.

# Outputs of experiments generated by a script called job_name
# will be saved in outputs/${outputs_subdir}/job_name/${job_subdir}/...
# This can further be useful to tag experiments run from the same script.
